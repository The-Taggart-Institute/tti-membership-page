        Our asynchronous courses will always be available for free. However, in our mission to continue to elevate the level of education in the technology sector, we are also offering live classes through the TTI Discord. Because these live classes expect a deeper level of engagement from both instructor and learner, we are asking for a small investment to participate in these intense sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TTI membership, at any level you choose, will grant access to live class signups, private discussion channels, and upon completion of the training, certificates of completion reflecting the hours of training, which you can use for continuing education credits.

        Click on one of the options below to choose your membership tier. All tiers provide the same benefit; it's just a matter of your level of generosity/investment. You will need your Discord username, as the live courses will be run through our <a href="https://discord.gg/taggartinstitute">Discord</a>. If you're not already a member there, join us!
