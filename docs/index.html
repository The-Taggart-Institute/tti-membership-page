      <p>
        Our asynchronous courses will always be available for free. However, in our mission to continue to elevate the level of education in the technology sector, we are also offering live classes through the TTI Discord. Because these live classes expect a deeper level of engagement from both instructor and learner, we are asking for a small investment to participate in these intense sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The TTI membership, at any level you choose, will grant access to live class signups, private discussion channels, and upon completion of the training, certificates reflecting the hours of training, which you can use for continuing education credits.
      </p>
      <h2>How it Works</h2>
      <p>
        Click on one of the options below to choose your membership tier. All tiers provide the same benefit; it's just a matter of your level of generosity/investment. You will need your Discord username, as the live courses will be run through our <a href="https://discord.gg/taggartinstitute">Discord</a>. If you're not already a member there, join us!

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p><b>Does this mean you (Taggart) won't be streaming anymore??</b></p>
      <p>
          Not at all. This is an effort to provide a new kind of teaching that streaming does not afford. Deep learning requires a connection between teacher and learner, and this is an attempt to cultivate that kind of connection, even in a remote learning environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I still love streaming, and will do it whenever I can.
      </p>
      <p><b>Why are you of all people charging money for courses?</b></p>
      <p>I know, it's a bit strange. Here's my thinking: I want to compensate instructors (not me) for presenting high quality instruction through TTI. I can only do that if the courses self-fund. So this model allows instructors to receive an honorarium for their time and effort.</p>
      <p>Also, since we want the participants to actually participate, we suspect a little financial investment will motivate folks to show up and do the work.</p>
      <p><b>How will classes be conducted?</b></p>
      <p>We will use the Discord platform to conduct courses. Classes will have a set start time, and learners will be expected to have done any requested work in between sessions. There will also be a dedicated chat/support channel for the course. Course sessions will be recorded and be made available to members</p>
      <p><b>How often will classes run?</b></p>
      <p>We're still figuring that out, but the objective is at least one course per month. Any more and it would really be too much for any learner to consume along with other obligations.</p>
      <p><b>How long will each class be?</b></p>
      <p>That will largely depend on the instructor, but we're targeting no more than 5 hour-long sessions over 2 weeks.</p>
      <p><b>Why don't higher tiers come with more perks?</b></p>
      <p>Do you want a T-shirt? A pony? A podcast? The reason for the membership is to support the instructors, not to gain some higher level benefit for yourself. Additionally, we believe that you will be more motivated to engage with the course material if you are literally invested. But the investment is at your level of ability to give and generosity, not your demand for perks.</p>
      <p><b>Can I sign up for a month for a course I like, then cancel?</b></p>
      <p>You can, although I really hope you won't. Remember that the membership is about supporting instructors, not access.</b></p>
      <p><b>Can I gift someone a membership?</b></p>
      <p>You can! At checkout, simply enter the Discord username (they need to be in the TTI Discord) of the user you want to receive the Membership. Keep in mind that this is an ongoing subscription, so you'll need to cancel it yourself if you want to only gift it for a limited time.</p>
      <p><b>I really want to participate, but I can't afford it!</b></p>
      <p>I understand and empathize. It's a difficult thing to ask for a financial investment from learners, and we're really trying to keep this small. We may do some scholarships/other opportunities in the future to make this somewhat easier.</p>
      <p><b>What if I want to give more?</b></p>
      <p>What?! Wow, okay you crazy diamond. Well first, thank you. I deeply appreciate the support for TTI's mission. Although I do not like asking for more than I think is fair, if you really_want to further support TTI, I've set up a <a href="https://liberapay.com/thetaggartinstitute">Liberapay</a> page for lunatics like you.</p>
